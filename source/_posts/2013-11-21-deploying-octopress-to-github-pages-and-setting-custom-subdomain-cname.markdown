Deployment

Octopress supports Heroku, rsync and Github Pages deployment. I chose the Github Pages because Github provide the CNAME changes, so the site can be on your desired domain.

Github Pages setup

There are two ways of having pages on the Github.

The User/Organization pages http://username.github.com and project pages gh-pages.

The my way was the User/Organization pages.

Setting up the repository on Github

Create new repository on Github and named it as your User/Organization name plus .github.com in my case was xajler.github.com.
